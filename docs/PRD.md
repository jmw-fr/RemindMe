# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## Product Name
RemindMe

## Purpose
RemindMe is a software application designed to help users set up reminders for various actions and tasks throughout the day. The goal is to improve productivity, organization, and ensure that important activities are not forgotten.

## Technology Stack & Platforms
- Web (browser-based)
- Android (mobile and tablet)
- iPhone (iOS mobile and tablet)
- Windows (desktop)
RemindMe will be developed using **Flutter** to ensure a single codebase for multiple platforms. The application will be available on:
- Web (browser-based)
- Android (mobile and tablet)
- iPhone (iOS mobile and tablet)
- Windows (desktop)

### State Management

RemindMe must use the **BLoC** (Business Logic Component) pattern as its state management library for predictable, scalable, and testable application state handling across all platforms.

### Platform-Specific Widgets

RemindMe must implement platform-specific widgets for each environment to ensure a native-like user experience and optimal integration with each platform's notification and reminder systems.
- Web (browser-based)
- Android (mobile and tablet)
- iPhone (iOS mobile and tablet)
- Windows (desktop)

#### Design Language
The app must use **Copernicus** design for Apple platforms (iOS) and **Material** design for all other platforms (Android, Web, Windows) to ensure a consistent and native look and feel.

## Backend Solution

RemindMe will use **Firebase** as its backend platform. Firebase provides:
- Real-time database and Firestore for storing reminders and user data
- Authentication using Google, Apple, or Microsoft accounts
- Cloud Functions for scheduled notifications and automation
- Cross-platform support (web, Android, iOS, Windows)
- Push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)

Firebase is scalable, easy to integrate with Flutter, and offers a generous free tier for small projects. It will handle user authentication, data storage, and notification delivery for RemindMe.
